## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The model is very big, and may require a dedicated GPU to run. AWS provides GPU's and can be experimented on with a free trial. 
npm
