really so small you might think such a thing wouldn't matter at all. but  because they had stars  all the star belly sneetches would brag  we're the best kind of sneetch on the beaches. with their snoots in the air  they would sniff and they'd snort we'll have nothing to do with the plain belly sort. and whenever they met some  when they were out walking  they'd hike right on past them without even talking. when the star belly children went out to play ball  could a plain belly get in the game. . not at all. you only could play if your bellies had stars. and the plain belly children had none upon thars. when the star belly sneetches had frankfurter roasts or picnics or parties or marshmallow toasts  they never invited the plain belly sneetches. they left them out cold  in the dark of the beaches. they kept them away. never let them come near. and that's how they treated them year after year. then one day  it seems. while the plain belly sneetches were moping and doping alone on the beaches  just sitting there wishing their bellies had stars. a stranger zipped up in the strangest of cars. my friends  he announced in a voice clear and keen  my name is sylvester mcmonkey mcbean. and i've heard of your troubles. i've heard you're unhappy. but i can fix that. i'm the fix it up chappie. i've come here to help you. i have what you need. and my prices are low. and i work at great speed. and my work is one hundred percent guaranteed. then  quickly sylvester mcmonkey mcbean put together a very peculiar machine. and he said  you want stars like a star belly sneetch. . my friends  you can have them for three dollars each. just pay me your money and hop right aboard. so they clambered inside. then the big machine roared and it klonked. and it bonked. and it jerked. and it berked. and it bopped them about. but the thing really worked. when the plain belly sneetches popped out  they had stars. they actually did. they had stars upon thars. then they yelled at the ones who had stars at the start  we're exactly like you. you can't tell us apart. we're all just the same  now  you snooty old smarties. and now we can go to your frankfurter parties. good grief. groaned the ones who had stars at the first. we're still the best sneetches and they are the worst. but  now  how in the world will we know  they all frowned  if which kind is what  or the other way round. then up came mcbean with a very sly wink and he said  things are not quite as bad as you think. so you don't know who's who. that is perfectly true. but come with me  friends. do you know what i'll do. i'll make you  again  the best sneetches on the beaches and all it will cost you is ten dollars eaches. belly stars are no longer in style  said mcbean. what you need is a trip through my star off machine. this wondrous contraption will take off your stars so you won't look like sneetches who have them on thars. and that handy machine working very precisely removed all the stars from their tummies quite nicely. then  with snoots in the air  they paraded about and they opened their beaks and they let out a shout  we know who is who. now there isn't a doubt. the best kind of sneetches are sneetches without. then  of course  those with stars got frightfully mad. to be wearing a star now was frightfully bad. then  of course  old sylvester mcmonkey mcbean invited them into his star off machine. then  of course from then on  as you probably guess  things really got into a horrible mess. all the rest of that day  on those wild screaming beaches  the fix it up chappie kept fixing up sneetches. off again. on again. in again. out again. through the machines they raced round and about again  changing their stars every minute or two. they kept paying money. they kept running through until neither the plain nor the star bellies knew whether this one was that one. or that one was this one or which one was what one. of what one was who. then  when every last cent of their money was spent  the fix it up chappie packed up and he went. and he laughed as he drove in his car up the beach  they never will learn. no. you can't teach a sneetch. but mcbean was quite wrong. i'm quite happy to say that the sneetches got really quite smart on that day  the day they decided that sneetches are sneetches and no kind of sneetch is the best on the beaches. that day  all the sneetches forgot about stars and whether they had one  or not  upon thars. fox in socks by dr. seuss fox socks box knox knox in box. fox in socks. knox on fox in socks in box. socks on knox and knox in box. fox

jungle’s great joys… when horton the elephant heard a small noise. so horton stopped splashing. he looked toward the sound. “that’s funny ” thought horton. “there’s no one around.” then he heard it again. just a very faint yelp as if some tiny person were calling for help. “i’ll help you ” said horton. “but who are you. where.” he looked and he looked. he could see nothing there but a small speck of dust blowing past through the air. “i say.” murmured horton. “i’ve never heard tell of a small speck of dust that is able to yell. so you know what i think.. why  i think that there must be someone on top of that small speck of dust. some sort of a creature of very small size  too small to be seen by an elephant’s eyes… “… some poor little person who’s shaking with fear that he’ll blow in the pool. he has no way to steer. i’ll just have to save him. because  after all  a person’s a person  no matter how small.” so  gently  and using the greatest of care  the elephant stretched his great trunk through the air  and he lifted th i do  these small persons may come to great harm. i can’t put it down. and i won’t. after all a person’s a person. no matter how small.” then horton stopped walking. the speck voice was talking. the voice was so faint he could just barley hear it. “speak up  please” said horton. he put his ear near it. “my friend ” came the voice  “you’re a very fine friend. you’ve helped all us folks on this dust speck no end. you’ve saved all our houses  our ceilings and floors. you’ve saved all our churches and grocery stores.” “you mean…” horton gasped  “you have buildings there  too.” “oh  yes ” piped the voice. “we most certainly do… “i know ” called the voice  “i’m too small to be seen but i’m mayor of a town that is friendly and clean. our buildings  to you  would seem terribly small but to us  who aren’t big  they are wonderfully tall. my town is called who ville  for i am a who and we whos are all thankful and grateful to you.” and horton called back to the mayor of the town  “you’re safe now. don’t worry. i won’t let you down.” but  just as he spoke to the mayor of the speck  three big jungle monkeys climbed up horton’s neck. the wickersham brothers came shouting  “what rot. this elephant’s talking to whos who are not. there aren’t any whos. and they don’t have a mayor. and we’re going to stop all the nonsense. so there.” they snatched horton’s clover. they carried it off to a black bottomed eagle named vlad vlad i koff  a mighty strong eagle  of very swift wing  and they said  “will you kindly get rid of this thing.” and  before the poor elephant even could speak  that eagle flew off with the flower in his beak. all that latte afternoon and far into the night that black bottomed bird flapped his wings in fast flight  while horton chased after  with groans  over stones that tattered his toenails and battered his bones  and begged  “please don’t harm all my little folks  who have as much right to live as us bigger folks do.” but far  far beyond him  that eagle kept flapping and over his shoulder called back  “quit your yapping. i’ll fly the night through. i’m a bird. i don’t mind it. and i’ll hide this  tomorrow  where you’ll never find it.” and at 6:56 the next morning he did it. it sure was a terrible place that he hid it. he let that small clover drop somewhere inside of a great patch of clovers a hundred miles wide. “find that.” sneered the bird. “but i think you will fail.” and he left with a flip of his blackbottomed tail. “i’ll find it.” cried horton. “i’ll find it or bust. i shall find my friends on my small speck of dust.” and clover  by clover  by clover with care he picked up and searched them  and called  “are you there.” but clover  by clover  by clover he found that the one that he sough for was just not around. and by noon poor old horton  more dead than alive  had picked  searched  and piled up  nine thousand and five. then  on through the afternoon  hour after hour… till he found them at last. on the three millionth flower. “my friends.” cried the elephant. “tell me. do tell. are you safe. are you sound. are you whole. are you well.” from down on the speck came the voice of the mayor: “we’ve really had trouble. much more that our share. when that black bottomed birdie let go and we dropped  we landed so hard that our clocks have all stopped. our tea pots are broken. our rocking chairs smashed. and our bicycle tired all blew up when we crashed. so  horton  please.” pleaded that voice of the mayor’s  “will you stick by us whos while we’re making repairs.” “of course ” horton answered. “of course i will stick. i’ll stick by you small folks through thin and through thick.” “humpf.” humpfed a voice. “for almost two days you’ve run wild and insisted on chatting with persons who’ve never existed. such carryings on in our peaceable jungle. we’ve had quite enough of your bellowing bungle. and i’m here to state ” snapped the big kangaroo  “that your silly nonsensical game is all through.” and the young kangaroo in her pouch said  “me  too.” “with the help of the wickersham brothers and dozens of wickersham uncles and wickersham cousins and wickersham in laws  whose help i’ve engaged  you’re going to be roped. and you’re going to be caged. and  as for our dust speck…hah. that we shall boil in hot steaming kettle of beezle nut oil.” “boil it..” gasped horton. “oh  that you can’t do. it’s all full of persons. they’ll prove it to you.” “mr. mayor. mr. mayor.” horton called. “mr. mayor. you’ve got to prove now that you really are there. so call a big meeting. get everyone out. make every who holler. make every who shout. make every who scream. if you don’t  every who is going to end up in a beezle nut stew.” and  down on the dust speck  the scared little mayor quick called a big meeting in who ville town square. and his people cried loudly. they cried out in fear: “we are here. we are here. we are here. we are here.” the elephant smiled: “that was clear as a bell. you kangaroos surely heard that very well.” “all i heard ” snapped the big kangaroo  “was the breeze  and the faint sound of wind through the far distant trees. i heard no small voices. and you didn’t either.” and the young kangaroo in her pouch said  “me  neither.” “grab him.” they shouted. “and cage the big dope. lasso his stomach with ten miles of rope. tie the knots tight so he’ll never shake loose. then dunk that dumb speck in the beezle nut juice.” horton fought back with great vigor and vim but the wickersham gang was too many for him. they beat him. they mauled him. they started to haul him into his cage. but he managed to call to the mayor: “don’t give up. i believe in you all. a person’s a person  no matter how small. and you very small persons will not have to die if you make yourselves heard. so come on  now  and try.” the mayor grabbed a tom tom. he started to smack it. and  all over who ville  they whooped up a racket. they rattled tin kettles. they beat on brass pans  on garbage pail tops and old cranberry cans. they blew on bazookas and blasted great toots on clarinets  oompahs and boom pahs and flutes. great gusts of loud racket rang high through the air. they rattled and shook the whole sky. and the mayor called up through the howling mad hullabaloo: “hey  horton. how’s this. is our sound coming through.” and horton called back  “i can hear you fine. but the kangaroos’ ears aren’t as strong  quite  as mine. they don’t hear a thing. are you sure all your boys are doing their best. are they all making noise. are you sure every who down in who ville is working. quick. look through your town. is there anyone shirking.” through the town rushed the mayor from the east to the west. but everyone seemed to be doing his best. everyone seemed to be yapping or yipping. everyone seemed to be beeping or bipping. but it wasn’t enough  all this ruckus and roar. he had to find someone to help him make more. he raced through each building. he searched floor to floor. and  just as he felt he as getting nowhere  and almost about to give up in despair  he suddenly burst through a door and that mayor discovered on shirker. quite hidden away in the fairfax apartments apartment 12 j a very small  very small shirker named jo jo was standing  and bouncing a yo yo. not making a sound. not a yipp. not a chirp. and the mayor rushed inside and he greabbed the young twerp. and he climbed with the lad up the eiffelberg tower. “this ” cried the mayor  “is your town’s darkest hour. the time for all whos who have blood that is red to come to the aid of their country.” he said. “we’ve got to make noises in greater amounts. so  open your mouth  lad. for every voice counts.” thus he spoke as he climbed. when they got to the top  the lad cleared his throat and he shouted out  “yopp.” and that yopp… that one small extra yopp put it over. finally  at last. from that speck on that clover their voices were heard. they rang out clear and clean. and the elephant smiled. “do you see what i mean.. they’ve proved they are persons  not matter how small. and their whole world was saved by the smallest of all.” “how true. yes  how true ” said the big kangaroo. “and  from now on  you know what i’m planning to do.. from now on  i’m going to protect them with you.” and the young kangaroo in her pouch said … “…me  too. from sun in the summer. from rain when it’s fall ish  i’m going to protect them. no matter how small ish.  how the grinch stole christmas by dr. suess every who down in whoville liked christmas a lot. but the grinch who lived just north of whoville  did not. the grinch hated christmas. the whole christmas season. now  please don't ask why. no one quite knows the reason. it could be his head wasn't screwed on just right. it could be  perhaps  that his shoes were too tight. but i think that the most likely reason of all  may have been that his heart was two sizes too small. whatever the reason  his heart or his shoes  he stood there on christmas eve  hating the whos  staring down from his cave with a sour  grinchy frown  at the warm lighted windows below in their town. for he knew every who down in whoville beneath  was busy now  hanging a mistletoe wreath. and they're hanging their stockings. he snarled with a sneer  tomorrow is christmas. it's practically here. then he growled  with his grinch fingers nervously drumming  i must find some way to stop christmas from coming. for tomorrow  he knew  all the who girls and boys  would wake bright and early. they'd rush for their toys. and then. oh  the noise. oh  the noise. noise. noise. noise. that's one thing he hated. the noise. noise. noise. noise. then the whos  young and old  would sit down to a feast. and they'd feast. and they'd feast. and they'd feast. feast. feast. feast. they would feast on who pudding  and rare who roast beast. which was something the grinch couldn't stand in the least. and then they'd do something he liked least of all. every who down in whoville  the tall and the small  would stand close together  with christmas bells ringing. they'd stand hand in hand. and the whos would start singing. they'd sing. and they'd sing. and they'd sing. sing. sing. sing. and the more the grinch thought of this who christmassing  the more the grinch thought  i must stop this whole thing. why  for fifty three years i've put up with it now. i must stop this christmas from coming. but how. then he got an idea. an awful idea. the grinch got a wonderful  awful idea. i know just what to do. the grinch laughed in his throat. and he made a quick santy claus hat and a coat. and he chuckled  and clucked  what a great grinchy trick. with this coat and this hat  i look just like saint nick. all i need is a reindeer. the grinch looked around. but  since reindeer are scarce  there was none to be found. did that stop the old grinch. no. the grinch simply said  if i can't find a reindeer  i'll make one instead. so he called his dog  max. then he took some red thread  and he tied a big horn on the top of his head. then he loaded some bags and some old empty sacks  on a ramshackle sleigh and he hitched up old max. then the grinch said  giddap. and the sleigh started down  toward the homes where the whos lay asnooze in their town. all their windows were dark. quiet snow filled the air. all the whos were all dreaming sweet dreams without care. when he came to the first little house on the square. this is stop number one  the old grinchy claus hissed  and he climbed to the roof  empty bags in his fist. then he slid down the chimney. a rather tight pinch. but  if santa could do it  then so could the grinch. he got stuck only once  for a moment or two. then he stuck his head out of the fireplace flue. where the little who stockings all hung in a row. these stockings  he grinned  are the first things to go. then he slithered and slunk  with a smile most unpleasant  around the whole room  and he took every present. pop guns. and bicycles. roller skates. drums. checkerboards. tricycles. popcorn. and plums. and he stuffed them in bags. then the grinch  very nimbly  stuffed all the bags  one by one  up the chimney. then he slunk to the icebox. he took the whos' feast. he took the who pudding. he took the roast beast. he cleaned out that icebox as quick as a flash. why  that grinch even took their last can of who hash. then he stuffed all the food up the chimney with glee. and now. grinned the grinch  i will stuff up the tree. and the grinch grabbed the tree  and he started to shove  when he heard a small sound like the coo of a dove. he turned around fast  and he saw a small who. little cindy lou who  who was not more than two. the grinch had been caught by this tiny who daughter  who'd got out of bed for a cup of cold water. she stared at the grinch and said  santy claus  why  why are you taking our christmas tree. why. but  you know  that old grinch was so smart and so slick  he thought up a lie  and he thought it up quick. why  my sweet little tot  the fake santy claus lied  there's a light on this tree that won't light on one side. so i'm taking it home to my workshop  my dear. i'll fix it up there. then i'll bring it back here. and his fib fooled the child. then he patted her head  and he got her a drink and he sent her to bed. and when cindylou who went to bed with her cup  he went to the chimney and stuffed the tree up. then the last thing he took was the log for their fire. then he went up the chimney  himself  the old liar. on their walls he left nothing but hooks and some wire. and the one speck of food that he left in the house  was a crumb that was even too small for a mouse. then he did the same thing to the other whos' houses leaving crumbs much too small for the other whos' mouses. it was quarter past dawn. all the whos  still a bed  all the whos  still asnooze when he packed up his sled  packed it up with their presents. the ribbons. the wrappings. the tags. and the tinsel. the trimmings. the trappings. three thousand feet up. up the side of mt. crumpit  he rode with his load to the tiptop to dump it. poohpooh to the whos. he was grinchishly humming. they're finding out now that no christmas is coming. they're just waking up. i know just what they'll do. their mouths will hang open a minute or two  then the whos down in whoville will all cry boohoo. that's a noise  grinned the grinch  that i simply must hear. so he paused. and the grinch put his hand to his ear. and he did hear a sound rising over the snow. it started in low. then it started to grow. but the sound wasn't sad. why  this sound sounded merry. it couldn't be so. but it was merry. very. he stared down at whoville. the grinch popped his eyes. then he shook. what he saw was a shocking surprise. every who down in whoville  the tall and the small  was singing. without any presents at all. he hadn't stopped christmas from coming. it came. somehow or other  it came just the same. and the grinch  with his grinch feet ice cold in the snow  stood puzzling and puzzling: how could it be so. it came with out ribbons. it came without tags. it came without packages  boxes or bags. and he puzzled three hours  till his puzzler was sore. then the grinch thought of something he hadn't before. maybe christmas  he thought  doesn't come from a store. maybe christmas.perhaps.means a little bit more. and what happened then. well.in whoville they say  that the grinch's small heart grew three sizes that day. and the minute his heart didn't feel quite so tight  he whizzed with his load through the bright morning light  and he brought back the toys. and the food for the feast. and he  he himself. the grinch carved the roast beast. oh baby  the places you'll go congratulations. today is your day. you're off to great places. you're off and away. you have brains in your head. you have feet in your shoes. you can steer yourself any direction you choose. you're on your own. and you know what you know. and you are the guy who'll decide where to go. you'll look up and down streets. look 'em over with care. about some you will say  i don't choose to go there. with your head full of brains and your shoes full of feet  you're too smart to go down any not so good street. and you may not find any you'll want to go down. in that case  of course  you'll head straight out of town. it's opener there in the wide open air. out there things can happen and frequently do to people as brainy and footsy as you. and then things start to happen  don't worry. don't stew. just go right along. you'll start happening too. oh. the places you'll go. you'll be on y our way up. you'll be seeing great sights. you'll join the high fliers who soar to high heights. you won't lag behind  because you'll have the speed. you'll pass the whole gang and you'll soon take the lead. wherever you fly  you'll be best of the best. wherever you go  you will top all the rest. except when you don't. because  sometimes  you won't. i'm sorry to say so but  sadly  it's true that bang ups and hang ups can happen to you. you can get all hung up in a prickle ly perch. and your gang will fly on. you'll be left in a lurch. you'll come down from the lurch with an unpleasant bump. and the chances are  then  that you'll be in a slump. and when you're in a slump  you're not in for much fun. un slumping yourself is not easily done. you will come to a place where the streets are not marked. some windows are lighted. but mostly they're darked. a place you could sprain both your elbow and chin. do you dare to stay out. do you dare to go in. how much can you lose. how much can you win. and if you go in  should you turn left or right. or right and three quarters. or  maybe  not quite. or go around back and sneak in from behind. simple it's not  i'm afraid you will find  for a mind maker upper to make up his mind. you can get so confused that you'll start in to race down long wiggled roads at a break necking pace and grind on for miles cross weirdish wild space  headed  i fear  toward a most useless place. the waiting place. .for people just waiting. waiting for a train to go or a bus to come  or a plane to go or the mail to come  or the rain to go or the phone to ring  or the snow to snow or the waiting around for a yes or no or waiting for their hair to grow. everyone is just waiting. waiting for the fish to bite or waiting for the wind to fly a kite or waiting around for friday night or waiting  perhaps  for their uncle jake or a pot to boil  or a better break or a string of pearls  or a pair of pants or a wig with curls  or another chance. everyone is just waiting. no. that's not for you. somehow you'll escape all that waiting and staying you'll find the bright places where boom bands are playing. with banner flip flapping  once more you'll ride high. ready for anything under the sky. ready because you're that kind of a guy. oh  the places you'll go. there is fun to be done. there are points to be scored. there are games to be won. and the magical things you can do with that ball will make you the winning est winner of all. fame. you'll be as famous as famous can be  with the whole wide world watching you win on tv. except when they don't because  sometimes they won't. i'm afraid that some times you'll play lonely games too. games you can't win 'cause you'll play against you. all alone. whether you like it or not  alone will be something you'll be quite a lot. and when you're alone  there's a very good chance you'll meet things that scare you right out of your pants. there are some  down the road between hither and yon  that can scare you so much you won't want to go on. but on you will go though the weather be foul. on you will go though your enemies prowl. on you will go though the hakken kraks howl. onward up many a frightening creek  though your arms may get sore and your sneakers may leak. on and on you will hike  and i know you'll hike far and face up to your problems whatever they are. you'll get mixed up  of course  as you already know. you'll get mixed up with many strange birds as you go. so be sure when you step. step with care and great tact and remember that life's a great balancing act. just never foget to be dexterous and deft. and never mix up your right foot with your left. and will you succeed. yes. you will  indeed. 98 and 3/4 percent guaranteed. kid  you'll move mountains. so. be your name buxbaum or bixby or bray or mordecai ali van allen o'shea  you're off the great places. today is your day. your mountain is waiting. so.get on your way. the sneetches now  the star belly sneetches had bellies with stars. the plain belly sneetches had none upon thars. those stars weren't so big. they were really so small you might think such a thing wouldn't matter at all. but  because they had stars  all the star belly sneetches would brag  we're the best kind of sneetch on the beaches. with their snoots in the air  they would sniff and they'd snort we'll have nothing to do with the plain belly sort. and whenever they met some  when they were out walking  they'd hike right on past them without even talking. when the star belly children went out to play ball  could a plain belly get in the game. . not at all. you only could play if your bellies had stars. and the plain belly children had none upon thars. when the star belly sneetches had frankfurter roasts or picnics or parties or marshmallow toasts  they never invited the plain belly sneetches. they left them out cold  in the dark of the beaches. they kept them away. never let them come near. and that's how they treated them year after year. then one day  it seems. while the plain belly sneetches were moping and doping alone on the beaches  just sitting there wishing their bellies had stars. a stranger zipped up in the strangest of cars. my friends  he announced in a voice clear and keen  my name is sylvester mcmonkey mcbean. and i've heard of your troubles. i've heard you're unhappy. but i can fix that. i'm the fix it up chappie. i've come here to help you. i have what you need. and my prices are low. and i work at great speed. and my work is one hundred percent guaranteed. then  quickly sylvester mcmonkey mcbean put together a very peculiar machine. and he said  you want stars like a star belly sneetch. . my friends  you can have them for three dollars each. just pay me your money and hop right aboard. so they clambered inside. then the big machine roared and it klonked. and it bonked. and it jerked. and it berked. and it bopped them about. but the thing really worked. when the plain belly sneetches popped out  they had stars. they actually did. they had stars upon thars. then they yelled at the ones who had stars at the start  we're exactly like you. you can't tell us apart. we're all just the same  now  you snooty old smarties. and now we can go to your frankfurter parties. good grief. groaned the ones who had stars at the first. we're still the best sneetches and they are the worst. but  now  how in the world will we know  they all frowned  if which kind is what  or the other way round. then up came mcbean with a very sly wink and he said  things are not quite as bad as you think. so you don't know who's who. that is perfectly true. but come with me  friends. do you know what i'll do. i'll make you  again  the best sneetches on the beaches and all it will cost you is ten dollars eaches. belly stars are no longer in style  said mcbean. what you need is a trip through my star off machine. this wondrous contraption will take off your stars so you won't look like sneetches who have them on thars. and that handy machine working very precisely removed all the stars from their tummies quite nicely. then  with snoots in the air  they paraded about and they opened their beaks and they let out a shout  we know who is who. now there isn't a doubt. the best kind of sneetches are sneetches without. then  of course  those with stars got frightfully mad. to be wearing a star now was frightfully bad. then  of course  old sylvester mcmonkey mcbean invited them into his star off machine. then  of course from then on  as you probably guess  things really got into a horrible mess. all the rest of that day  on those wild screaming beaches  the fix it up chappie kept fixing up sneetches. off again. on again. in again. out again. through the machines they raced round and about again  changing their stars every minute or two. they kept paying money. they kept running through until neither the plain nor the star bellies knew whether this one was that one. or that one was this one or which one was what one. of what one was who. then  when every last cent of their money was spent  the fix it up chappie packed up and he went. and he laughed as he drove in his car up the beach  they never will learn. no. you can't teach a sneetch. but mcbean was quite wrong. i'm quite happy to say that the sneetches got really quite smart on that day  the day they decided that sneetches are sneetches and no kind of sneetch is the best on the beaches. that day  all the sneetches forgot about stars and whether they had one  or not  upon thars. i am sam i am sam sam i am that sam i am that sam i am. i do not

 how i wish we had something to do. too wet to go out and too cold to play ball. so we sat in the house. we did nothing at all. so all we could do was to sit. sit. sit. sit. and we did not like it. not one little bit. bump. and then something went bump. how that bump made us jump. we looked. then we saw him step in on the mat. we looked. and we saw him. the cat in the hat. and he said to us  why do you sit there like that. i know it is wet and the sun is not sunny. but we can have lots of good fun that is funny. i know some good games we could play  said the cat. i know some new tricks  said the cat in the hat. a lot of good tricks. i will show them to you. your mother will not mind at all if i do. then sally and i did not know what to say. our mother was out of the house for the day. but our fish said  no. no. make that cat go away. tell that cat in the hat you do not want to play. he should not be here. he should not be about. he should not be here when your mother is out. now. now. have no fear. have no fear. said the cat. my tricks are not bad  said the cat in the hat. why  we can have lots of good fun  if you wish  with a game that i call up up up with a fish. put me down. said the fish. this is no fun at all. put me down. said the fish. i do not wish to fall. have no fear. said the cat. i will not let you fall. i will hold you up high as i stand on a ball. with a book on one hand. and a cup on my hat. but that is not all i can do. said the cat. look at me. look at me now. said the cat. with a cup and a cake on the top of my hat. i can hold up two books. i can hold up the fish. and a litte toy ship. and some milk on a dish. and look. i can hop up and down on the ball. but that is not all. oh  no. that is not all. look at me. look at me. look at me now. it is fun to have fun but you have to know how. i can hold up the cup and the milk and the cake. i can hold up these books. and the fish on a rake. i can hold the toy ship and a little toy man. and look. with my tail i can hold a red fan. i can fan with the fan as i hop on the ball. but that is not all. oh  no. that is not all. that is what the cat said. then he fell on his head. he came down with a bump from up there on the ball. and sally and i  we saw all the things fall. and our fish came down  too. he fell into a pot. he said  do i like this. oh  no. i do not. this is not a good game  said our fish as he lit. no  i do not like it  not one little bit. now look what you did. said the fish to the cat. now look at this house. look at this. look at that. you sank our toy ship  sank it deep in the cake. you shook up our house and you bent our new rake. you should not be here when our mother is not. you get out of this house. said the fish in the pot. but i like to be here. oh  i like it a lot. said the cat in the hat to the fish in the pot. i will not go away. i do not wish to go. and so  said the cat in the hat  so so so. i will show you another good game that i know. and then he ran out. and  then  fast as a fox  the cat in the hat came back in with a box. a big red wood box. it was shut with a hook. now look at this trick  said the cat. take a look. then he got up on top with a tip of his hat. i call this game fun in a box  said the cat. in this box are two things i will show to you now. you will like these two things  said the cat with a bow. i will pick up the hook. you will see something new. two things. and i call them thing one and thing two. these things will not bite you. they want to have fun. then  out of the box came thing two and thing one. and they ran to us fast. they said  how do you do. would you like to shake hands with thing one and thing two. and sally and i did not know what to do. so we had to shake hands with thing one and thing two. we shook their two hands. but our fish said  no. no. those things should not be in this house. make them go. they should not be here when your mother is not. put them out. put them out. said the fish in the pot. have no fear  little fish  said the cat in the hat. these things are good things. and he gave them a pat. they are tame. oh  so tame. they have come here to play. they will give you some fun on this wet  wet  wet day. now  here is a game that they like  said the cat. they like to fly kites  said the cat in the hat no. not in the house. said the fish in the pot. they should not fly kites in a house. they should not. oh  the things they will bump. oh  the things they will hit. oh  i do not like it. not one little bit. then sally and i saw them run down the hall. we saw those two things bump their kites on the wall. bump. thump. thump. bump. down the wall in the hall. thing two and thing one. they ran up. they ran down. on the string of one kite we saw mother's new gown. her gown with the dots that are pink  white and red. then we saw one kite bump on the head of her bed. then those things ran about with big bumps  jumps and kicks and with hops and big thumps and all kinds of bad tricks. and i said  i do not like the way that they play if mother could see this  oh  what would she say. then our fish said  look. look. and our fish shook with fear. your mother is on her way home. do you hear. oh  what will she do to us. what will she say. oh  she will not like it to find us this way. so  do something. fast. said the fish. do you hear. i saw her. your mother. your mother is near. so  as fast as you can  think of something to do. you will have to get rid of thing one and thing two. so  as fast as i could  i went after my net. and i said  with my net i can get them i bet. i bet  with my net  i can get those things yet. then i let down my net. it came down with a plop. and i had them. at last. thoe two things had to stop. then i said to the cat  now you do as i say. you pack up those things and you take them away. oh dear. said the cat  you did not like our game. oh dear. what a shame. what a shame. what a shame. then he shut up the things in the box with the hook. and the cat went away with a sad kind of look. that is good  said the fish. he has gone away. yes. but your mother will come. she will find this big mess. and this mess is so big and so deep and so tall  we ca not pick it up. there is no way at all. and then. who was back in the house. why  the cat. have no fear of this mess  said the cat in the hat. i always pick up all my playthings and so. i will show you another good trick that i know. then we saw him pick up all the things that were down. he picked up the cake  and the rake  and the gown  and the milk  and the strings  and the books  and the dish  and the fan  and the cup  and the ship  and the fish. and he put them away. then he said  that is that. and then he was gone with a tip of his hat. then our mother came in and she said to us two  did you have any fun. tell me. what did you do. and sally and i did not know what to say. should we tell her the things that went on there that day. should we tell her about it. now  what should we do. well. what would you do if your mother asked you.
